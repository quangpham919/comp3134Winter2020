Sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all the packages passing through a given network using sniffing tools

How network sniffing works: 
Attacker forces switch to behave as a hub 

Passive Sniffing:
Traffic is recoreded but not altered (only listening) 

Active Sniffing: 
Traffic is monitored and maybe altered 
Injects address resolution packets into a target network to flood on the switch
